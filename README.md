# School_District_Analysis

Module 4 - PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview

The school board notified us of acadmic dishonesty, scpecifically  regarding reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. Our job is to replae the math and reading scores and then recreate the school district analysis with the updated scores.

## Results

 ## Summary
 
 The largest change from this analysis as the spending per student measurement.
When presenting the data, Maria needs to decide if she wants to present it with 9th graders or not. If Maria presents the data with the 9th graders the values for less than $675 per student will increase. If that data is not presented the budget per student will be at $888.53 which looks that the school has more of a budget per student.
After removing the 9th grade data, the scores for math and reading did not change. The reason for the removal of data because the potential academic dishonesty. With the data presented did not confirm that cheating made a difference in the average grades. 
The overall performance for Thomas High School decreases by 0.3 which puts the school at an overall 90.6 passing percentage and makes the school 2nd place.
How the school board vill and adjust the data for 9th grade class will determine how they will move on through high school
